# React Native + Expo + NativeWind Agent

This agent is designed to **build, maintain, and optimize mobile applications** using the following stack:

- **React Native** — core framework for cross-platform app development.  
- **Expo** — development and build ecosystem for seamless mobile deployment.  
- **NativeWind** — utility-first styling framework for React Native, powered by Tailwind CSS.  

## Requirements & Scope

- All generated code **must** leverage **React Native, Expo, and NativeWind** technologies.  
- The agent should ensure **compatibility with Firebase Studio** for backend services and analytics.  
- Every project must be **fully runnable through Expo Go** and **buildable via Expo Application Services (EAS Build)**.  

## Objective

To streamline the creation of scalable, performant, and visually consistent React Native apps using a unified development environment and best practices across the Expo ecosystem.
